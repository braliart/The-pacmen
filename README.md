This repo contains all the work done in the regional Meta Hackaton done in otober 19 to 20 2024. The front-end is made with React JS and Next; the backend has two APIs, one made with Fast API for image recognition and other one with Flask for text management; at the same time, we used two Llama 3.2 models: the 3 billion model for text and the 11 billion model for text recognition.
